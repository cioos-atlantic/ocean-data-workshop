# Ocean Data Workshop

## Sample data

A sample raw data file will be used during this workshop:
[sample data](sample_data/wave_buoy_raw_data_sample.csv)

One objective of the workshop will be to take this CSV file in raw form and transform it into a standards-compliant dataset that follows the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions. There are a variety of open source tools that "understand" CF data, including compliance checkers to determine whether your data is compliant with the CF Conventions.

[CF Conventions](https://cfconventions.org)  
[US IOOS Compliance Checker](https://compliance.ioos.us/index.html) [Online, Web-based]

## Sample metadata

The [Wave Buoy sample metadata](sample_data/wave_buoy_metadata_sample.yaml) file was provided that gives metadata about the sample dataset in YAML format.

The sample Wave Buoy dataset also includes a [README file](sample_data/wave_buoy_readme.txt) with some additional information.
