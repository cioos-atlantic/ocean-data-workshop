# Ocean Data Workshop

## Sample data

A sample raw data file will be used during this workshop:
[sample data](sample_data/antigonish_sensorstring_data.csv)

One objective of the workshop will be to take this CSV file in raw form and transform it into a standards-compliant dataset that follows the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions. There are a variety of open source tools that "understand" CF data, including compliance checkers to determine whether your data is compliant with the CF Conventions.

[CF Conventions](https://cfconventions.org) 

[CF Standard Names table](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html) 

[US IOOS Compliance Checker](https://compliance.ioos.us/index.html) [Online, Web-based]

## Sample metadata

The [Antigonish Sensor String metadata](sample_data/antigonish_sensorstring_metadata.yaml) file was provided that gives metadata about the sample dataset in YAML format.

The sample Antigonish sensor string dataset also includes a [README file](sample_data/antigonish_sensorstring_readme.txt) with some additional information.
