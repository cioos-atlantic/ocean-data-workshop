# Ocean Data Workshop

## Sample data

A sample raw data file will be used during this workshop:
[sample data](sample_data/wave_buoy_raw_sample.csv)

One objective of the workshop will be to take this CSV file in raw form and transform it into a standards-compliant dataset that follows the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions. There are a variety of open source tools that "understand" CF data, including compliance checkers to determine whether your data is compliant with the CF Conventions.

[US IOOS Compliance Checker](https://compliance.ioos.us/index.html) [Online, Web-based]
