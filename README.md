# Ocean Data Workshop

## Sample data

A sample raw data file will be used during this workshop:
[sample data](sample_data/wsp_wave_buoy_raw.csv)

One objective of the workshop will be to take this CSV file in raw form and transform it into a standards-compliant dataset, following the CF conventions.
