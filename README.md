# Ocean Data Workshop

## Sample data

A sample raw data file will be used during this workshop:
[sample data](sample_data/wsp_wave_buoy_raw.csv)

One objective of the workshop will be to take this CSV file in raw form and transform it into a standards-compliant dataset, following the CF conventions.

### ISO 19115 Metadata

Most international ocean observing systems use the [ISO 19115 Geograophic information metadata standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html), and extend the ISO19115 schema for use in their regions. 

ISO 19115 is made up from ISO19115-1 which defines the core standard, the ISO19115-2 extension for acquisition and processing, and ISO19115-3 which defines the XML schema implementation.

For more information about the ISO 19115 standard and how it has been implemented across different regions and organizations globally, see the [Research Data Alliance (RDA) metadata standards page](https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/msc/m22).
